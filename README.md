Inspired by Cris’ [website nutrition label sketch](http://itp.3laab.com/2016/10/13/nutrition-facts/) as well as [McSweeney’s Guide to Ambiguous Grammar](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/an-interactive-guide-to-ambiguous-grammar), I used a combination of P5.js and the [RiTa computational literature library](https://rednoise.org/rita/) to create a visual tool for identifying parts-of-speech types. 

The text content is pulled from today’s most-emailed articles from the New York Time’s website and grouped by reporting desk. When hovering over any of the menu items, the corresponding words are highlighted in the text. The contrast between the faded words and selected words provide a rhythm and instant visual indictor for the most common type of word across sections.
